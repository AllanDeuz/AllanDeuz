# Hi

currently in terms of **web development** I prefer to work with **react** + **sass** in the _frontend_, **laravel** in the _backend_ and the **mysql** or **postgresql** _database_.

for the **development** of **automation applications** and **functions** for the treatment of **sound**, **data** or **others** I use **python**.

I like learning.

In particular, I am very interested in mathematics, science and engineering, and I would like to use that knowledge to contribute and generate a better world.

_I am an eternal student and I like that :3_


If you need help or support in any project, **contact me!**
